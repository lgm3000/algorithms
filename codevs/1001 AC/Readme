A blend of
	Union find algorithm
&
	slightly varied Kruskal Algorithm

Most errors were minor shit ones, i.e. in QS, incorrect if statements, mixed up i, j notations

The program selects the minimal tree in which both the beginning and end nodes are present, by adding branches one by one;
	Then cuts off smaller routes, until the tree becomes invalid.

Expected Time Complexity O(m^2)
Optimizations done to following conditions:
	-The tree is a Long tree, the required nodes are at both ends.O(m^2)->O(m)
